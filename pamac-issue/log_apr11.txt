----------------issue: 
jre17 and jdk17 in conflict, try to delete but cannot delete because "breaks dependency pacman<6.1 of libpamac-git", but when check pactree of libpamac-git it says requires pacman>=6.0. 

when do full system upgrades (before this time) the requirement may have been updated, which reflects in the pactree, but some part of the program/set of packages does not get the memo? 

when triggering the delete jre17 process, a dependency was not satisfied--my guess is that the deletion process requires pacman>=6.1. that's why the system immediately runs to install pacman 6.1. but then the troublesome dependency requirement "pacman<6.1" appear and terminates the installation process. when installation is terminated, deletion process of jre17 is also terminated. 

trivia: in yay, the process is rolled back 3 times at most. in pacman -Syu, the process is not rolled back and the entire program halts immediately.

----------------logs when running `yay` or `pacman -Syu` to do full system upgrade:
