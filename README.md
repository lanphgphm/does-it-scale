# DOES IT SCALE? 

A rhetorical question only. I asked myself is it worth making a repo to store my logs whe debugging problems I have with my OS. Do I have enough problems to justify a whole repo? Is that a relevant question? 

Would my problems scale up enough to justify keeping a journal ofthe troubleshooting process? 

Does it scale? 

I think the answer is no. It doesn't scale. But it also doesn't matter if it scales. I find logs useful because I can recall my thoughts during the process.
